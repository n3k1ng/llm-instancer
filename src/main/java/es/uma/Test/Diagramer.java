                You are tasked with creating a 2D diagram in Python based on a provided instance of components, their positions, connections, and relationships. Follow these requirements carefully:
                - Represent each component as a colored bullet point corresponding to its type or label.
                - Label each bullet point with its name or identifier, displayed near the bullet.
                - Draw conveyors between components to indicate connections (as defined in the instance).
                - The color of the conveyors must match the color of the starting bullet point.
                - If conveyors overlap shift them introducing an perpendicular offset gap (its okey if they do not longer connect with the points).
                - Include an x-axis and y-axis to represent the positions of components. 
                - Scale the axis accordingly to ensure full visibility of the diagram.
                - Use grid lines to make it easier to read the positions of component.
                - The bulletpoints and arrows/conveyors should be small.
